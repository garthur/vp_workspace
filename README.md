VP Workspace

The VP Workspace seeks to provide a system for easy vector and derivative operations. The interface will allow a user to perform operations such as: finding derivatives, evaluating functions, and finding gradient vectors. The app attempts to do this in a “workspace” style environment, in which the user has control over how he/she wishes to manipulate the vectors and polynomials at hand. Users will create an object simply by clicking in the workspace and enter its elements via fields in dialogue boxes. After that, the user will be able to manipulate the object, perform operations with it, or move the object around the workspace to interact with others. This allows for flexibility when performing operations that often require a combination of these different types of objects.
